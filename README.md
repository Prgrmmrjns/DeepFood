# DeepFood

## Description
This is a Python Streamlit application that uses the Food101 dataset and Transfer learning via the EfficientNetb0 model
to classify uploaded images of food.
You can find my implementation here: https://prgrmmrjns-deepfood-streamlit-app-h7tlgr.streamlit.app/

## Next steps
* Estimate the amount of food in the picture
* Give background information about the food
* Extend food classes and increase performance
